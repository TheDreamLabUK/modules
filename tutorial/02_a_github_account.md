# Chapter 2a: Creating Your GitHub Account

Your [GitHub](https://github.com) account serves as your gateway to a vast ecosystem of code, collaboration, and open-source projects. It will also be central to managing your own projects and contributions.

## Steps to Create Your GitHub Account (approx. 5 mins)

Follow these steps to set up your GitHub account:

1. **Navigate to GitHub's Sign-up Page:**
   - Open your web browser and visit [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

2. **Enter Your Email Address:**
   - Provide a valid email address that you can access. GitHub will use this for verification and notifications.

3. **Create a Strong Password:**
   - Choose a secure, unique password.

4. **Select a Username:**
   - Your username will form part of your public profile URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername`) and potentially your [GitHub Pages](./05_github_pages.md) URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/project-name`).
   - Choose a username that is professional and memorable, especially if you intend to use GitHub for your portfolio or public-facing projects.
   - Note: Popular usernames may already be taken, so you might need to be creative.

5. **Set Email Preferences:**
   - Decide whether you wish to receive product updates and announcements from GitHub.

6. **Verify Your Account:**
   - Complete any verification steps (such as solving a CAPTCHA) to confirm you are human.

7. **Click "Create account":**
   - Proceed by clicking the "Create account" button.

8. **Verify Your Email Address:**
   - GitHub will send a verification email to the address you provided. You must complete this verification step before continuing.

9. **Personalisation (Optional):**
   - GitHub may ask you questions about your interests and intended use of the platform. You can answer these or skip them.

10. **Choose Your Plan:**
    - Select the **Free** plan. This plan provides unlimited public and private repositories and is sufficient for most individual users and small teams.

## Importance of Your GitHub Presence

Establishing a GitHub presence is beneficial for several reasons:

- **Professional Visibility:** Employers and collaborators often review GitHub profiles to assess skills and contributions.
- **Community Engagement:** GitHub is central to open-source software development, providing opportunities to collaborate and contribute to community projects.
- **Identity and Reputation:** A well-maintained GitHub profile demonstrates your active participation in the open-source and technical communities.

Once your account is created and verified, you are ready to proceed with setting up your local development environment.
