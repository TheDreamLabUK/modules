# Chapter 2a: Creating Your GitHub Account

Your [GitHub](https://github.com) account is your entry point into a vast ecosystem of code, collaboration, and open-source projects. It will also be central to managing your own work.

## Steps to Create Your Account (approx. 5 mins)

1.  **Navigate to the Sign-up Page:**
    Open your web browser and go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

2.  **Enter Your Email:**
    Provide a valid email address that you have access to. This will be used for verification and notifications.

3.  **Create a Password:**
    Choose a strong, unique password.

4.  **Pick a Username:**
    *   This is an important step. Your username will be part of your public profile URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername`) and potentially part of your [GitHub Pages](./05_github_pages.md) website URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/project-name`).
    *   Choose something memorable and professional if you intend to use this account for your portfolio or public-facing work.
    *   As noted in the workshop, "you sure do want to get your username right... most of them are gone, it's the nature of the beast."
    *   **A Note on Multiple Accounts:** The workshop transcript mentions that some developers create new accounts for specific contracts or projects (e.g., "John Cook... makes a new GitHub account under the IT department of whoever he's doing the contract for"). While this is possible, for building a consistent public footprint, having one primary account where your contributions accumulate can be beneficial. You can always create private repositories for work you don't want to share publicly. Don't stress too much; you can create other accounts later if needed. The key is to get started.

5.  **Email Preferences:**
    Decide if you want to receive product updates and announcements.

6.  **Verify Your Account:**
    You might need to solve a puzzle to prove you're human.

7.  **Click "Create account".**

8.  **Verify Your Email Address:**
    GitHub will send a verification code or link to the email address you provided. You **must** complete this verification step before moving on.

9.  **Personalisation (Optional):**
    GitHub might ask you a few questions about your interests and how you plan to use GitHub (e.g., "What is it we want to do first so they can customize?"). You can fill this out or skip it. The workshop advice was, "I'm not sure it sounds like a good option, but any of the first ones as well are fine. It slightly nuances the menus."

10. **Choose Your Plan:**
    *   Select the **Free** plan. This plan offers unlimited public and private repositories and is more than sufficient for our needs and for most individual developers.
    *   The workshop explicitly states: "Choose the Free plan."

## Why Your GitHub Presence Matters

As highlighted in the workshop:

*   **Professional Footprint:** "If you're applying for jobs, some jobs they're going to want to look at your GitHub... It's useful to have a footprint on here because it is the home of open-source software."
*   **Community & Collaboration:** "Creative technologists make open-source software... it's useful to start having a presence on it."
*   **Identity:** "It will just give you like a user ID on here that shows that you've got a presence in the open-source community."

Once your account is created and your email is verified, you're ready for the next step in setting up your development environment.
